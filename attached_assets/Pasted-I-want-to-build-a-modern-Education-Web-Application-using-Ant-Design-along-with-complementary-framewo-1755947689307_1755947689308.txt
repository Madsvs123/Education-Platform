I want to build a modern Education Web Application using Ant Design along with complementary frameworks

Requirements:
1. General Setup
Use React with Ant Design as the primary UI framework and add use complementary frameworks like framermotion.
Use i18next (or a similar library) for internationalization (i18n) support with English and Arabic languages.
Store translations in a single file (translations.json) with both English and Arabic text.
Ensure RTL (right-to-left) support for Arabic pages.
Responsive layout with a uniform modern theme and creative/educational-friendly fonts.
2. Pages
Home Page

Hero section with call-to-action for learners and teachers.
Highlight features like "Learn Online", "Courses", "Tutors".
Courses Page

Course listings with filters (categories, difficulty, subject).
Each course card should have: thumbnail, title, description, duration, and “Enroll” button.
Tutors/Teachers Page

Show a grid/list of tutors with profile cards (image, name, subject, rating, bio).
About Page

Mission, vision, about the platform.
Blog/Articles Page

List of articles/resources with a detail view for each.
Contact Page

Contact form for inquiries (name, email, message) with validation.
Auth Pages

Login and Register forms styled with Ant Design components.
3. Navigation & Layout
Top Navigation Bar with links to all main pages + Language Switcher (EN/AR).
Footer with links to Social Media, Terms & Conditions, Privacy Policy.
Layout should be consistent across all pages with Ant Design’s Layout components (Header, Sider, Content, Footer).
4. Theme & Style
Use Ant Design Theming customization for brand colors.
Creative fonts suited for educational content (Google Fonts: "Poppins" for English, "Cairo" or "Amiri" for Arabic).
Consistent button styles, headings, and cards across pages.

add other pages with options and sections and you don't have to follow the image, create your own design and theme and just take the inspiration
uniform the there and take your own color
